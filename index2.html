                Cao Xueqin, with the courtesy name Mengruan and the pen name Xueqin, was a novelist in the <u> late Qing Dynasty</u>. 
                He was born into a family of officials and scholars, and was well-read from a young age. In addition, he experienced the luxurious and refined lifestyle of wealthy families in the late Qing Dynasty.
                Later, his family fell on hard times and Cao Xueqin was forced to wander.
                After experiencing many twists and turns, he saw the essence of China's feudal society. 
                He used artistic techniques to describe the tragic love story of a pair of devoted lovers, as well as the daily life of feudal aristocrats to reflect the inevitable decline of feudal society.
                Cao Xueqin is the author of the Chinese classic novel "Dream of the Red Chamber".
